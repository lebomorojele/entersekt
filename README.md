# Entersekt demo sdk + native app example

EntersektSDK is a framework demoing basic network requests to a mock server with the goal of querying for broad and specific cities, malls and shops. This framework is built to only run on actual devices. Building this should produce a .framework.

EntersektApp is an simple example application demoing the features of the above framework in a simple UI.

#### Note
The EntersektSDK framework is build to support real devices and lacks support for simulators at the moment. This carries over into the demo EntersektApp. Please run on a real device.
